# Actors in Earthdawn

Actors are the base for every Roleplaying game. without them there would be no interaction, no Heros battling evil Horrors, no NPC holding important information. There are a lot of different types of Actors. The Earthdawn system contains ten different types of actors. Starting with the most important one, the Character, which is the actor used to create player characters, followed by an NPC which has more freedom in terms of the calculation of characteristics and other values. But there are a lot more:

* Character
* NPC
* Creature
* Spirit
* Horror
* Dragon
* Group
* Vehicle
* Trap
* Loot

The decision to have these many actor types was made due to their different behaviors.
