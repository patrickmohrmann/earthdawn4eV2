### UC_LpTracking-History

The Use Case UC_LpTracking-History covers the tracking of Legend points of an actor, every add, edit or deletion will be tracked. Two different overviews are available in the History prompt, showing an History of all earned legend Points and another History shows all spendings of legend Points. Each of the tabs have a check to show deletions as well. if this is checked, the deleted history entries will be shown.

### UC_LpTracking-Attributes

this covers enhancing attribute values. First the system setting for maximum Attribute enhancements and the setting for the type of Attribute enhancement options will be checked and evaluated if the attribute is able to be enhanced. A validation prompt will appear and show the relevant information (based on the setting). On confirmation the Attribute will be enhanced and the Legendpoints will be booked.

<a name="UC_LpTracking-addAbility"></a>
### UC_LpTracking-addAbility

this functionality is responsible for adding devotions, skills or talents to the actor. All Items will be added to the actor with Rank 0, so there is no Legend points required. An entry will be created nonetheless with Legend points amount = 0, for consistency purpose. 

Skills and devotions will be added to the actor without a prompt or required interaction.

Talents on the other hand create a prompt which requests the user to chose which talent category the talent shall be added to (discipline, optional, free, other) and which Tier this talent shall get (novice, journeyman, warden or master).

if the actor has a talent with the ed-id "versatility" a check will be done, to see if the number of talents with the talent category of "versatility" is lower than the rank of the sum of all talents with the ed-id "versatility". In that case another option will be available in the prompt allowing the user to learn the new talent as a versatility talent (for those talents there is no novice option for the tier selection)

### UC_LpTracking-upgradeAbility

This use case is responsible for upgrading devotions, skills and talents. all abilities have an upgrade button (arrow up) on the list view which will start the upgrade process, by checking if the ability has not yet reached the maximum level (devotions 12, skills 10 and talents 15). A prompt will appear after this check with information about the required and current legend points. A Button "spend Lp" will upgrade the ability by spending the required Legend Points if they are available, otherwise it will not increase the ability. The Free button will enhance the ability without spending any legend points. An LpTransactionData will be created in either case.

<a name="UC_LpTracking-Knacks"></a>
### UC_LpTracking-Knacks

Adding Knacks to the actor is done by dropping a knack item to the Actor. Several checks will start:
1: is the talentIdentifier matching one talent with the same identifier of the actor?
2: is the rank of the previously found talent at least as high as the minimum required rank of the knack?
3: is the number of knacks with the same talentIdentifier lower than the parent talents rank?
if all those checks are done, a validation prompt opens showing the user the required and current legend points and provide him with the option to spend LP, add the knack for free or cancel the operation. Both confirmation will create an LpTransactionData.

### UC_LpTracking-Spells

This use case covers the learning of new spells functionality. If a spell item is dropped to an actor of type character, a prompt will open to chose one of the grimoire items of the character (see [Grimoire Items](https://github.com/patrickmohrmann/earthdawn4eV2/wiki/FS-Grimoire-Items) ). the Prompt provides information about the current and required legend points. The Prompt can be confirmed with a free button (not using any LP) or the confirm button (only possible if enough LP are available) or the interaction can be cancelled.

<a name="UC_LpTracking-Classes"></a>
### UC_LpTracking-Classes

This Use Case handles the increase of Class Items (Disciplines, Paths and Questors). The increase is triggered by the upgrade icon in the Character Sheet (arrow up) on the respective class item. The trigger will first decide which class item shall be enhanced and then checks if the item itself is not at the max Rank/Circle.

For discipline items the system settings for Talent increases will be taken into account and the current talents of the actor - linked to the discipline - will be checked against this setting. Furthermore it will be checked if the actor has enough Legend points to at least upgrade the discipline talent of the next circle. 
If all those checks are done, a prompt appears to request the user to select the optional talent for this circle. The optional Talent options will be collected from the pools of the class item. Chosen Talents will not appear again in that list. Confirming this prompt will add all discipline- and free - talents as well as all effects and special abilities of that circle in addition to the chosen optional Talent to the actor. All talents will get the tier updated to the new level. In addition the field for the source Class and the level added to the actor will be set.  
In addition to that, the circle of the class item will be increased by one and all free talents of this discipline will be upgraded to be on the same level.

For Path items, there will be only one check, which is, to verify, if the path talent is at least as high as the new level. If this check is done, a prompt will appear requesting the user to choose the talent from the list. Confirming the prompt will add the chosen talent as well as any other ability of effect from the pools area of that rank to the actor. 
In addition the rank of the path will be increased by one.

for Questor items, there will be only one check, which is, to verify, if the questor devotion is at least as high as the new level. If this check is done, a prompt will appear requesting the user to choose the devotion from the list. Confirming the prompt will add the chosen devotion as well as any other ability of effect from the pools area of that rank to the actor. 
In addition the rank of the path will be increased by one.

## UF-LpTracking_assignLp

this functionality is triggered by the chat command /lp (GM only) and will create a prompt with a field for the Legend Points, another field for a dedicated description, and the option to assign Actors of type Character. 

The Actors shown in this list are:
* all Actors which are configured to an active user (selected by default)
* all Actors which are configured to an inactive user 
* all Actors which are owned by a player but are not configured yet.

confirming the prompt will create one TransactionData for every selected Actor (see [UF_LpTracking-addLpTransaction](#UF_LpTracking-addLpTransaction) )

<a name="UF_LpTracking-addLpTransaction"></a>
## UF_LpTracking-addLpTransaction

this functionality creates an entry in either actor.system.lp.earnings or actor.system.lp.spendings. In addition every entry of either paths will as well be create an entry in actor.system.lp.log. 

Each entry contains the following data:
amount
date
lpBefore
lpAfter
description

spendings have a few **additional** data:
type
name
value.before
value.after
itemUuid


<a name="UF_LpTracking-legendPointHistoryLog"></a>
## UF_LpTracking-legendPointHistoryLog

## UF_LpTracking-deleteLegendPointHistoryEntries

reverts the selected History entry (only for spendings). it is only possible to delete the last entry per itemUuid (or name if no uuid is available. e.g. attributes). the revert creates another LpTransactionData entry in [UF_LpTracking-addLpTransaction](#UF_LpTracking-addLpTransaction) which has the type "log". this entry shows the reverted data for:
* amount
* value.before
* value.after

description has the entry "revert"

<a name="UF_LpTracking-editLegendPointHistoryEntries"></a>
## UF_LpTracking-editLegendPointHistoryEntries

2. the rank of that talent has to be at least equal to the min Rank of the knack
3. the source talent has less than its ranks in related knacks

<a name="UF_LpTracking-upgradeDiscipline"></a>
