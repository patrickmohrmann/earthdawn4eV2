# Basics

## Rolls

The Earthdawn system supports three different ways of dice rolling, these are action-, effect and arbitrary tests. The dice used for every step are defined by the step table selection in the **system settings** (first, classic, third or fourth edition). the Fourth Edition setting is the default.

### Action Tests

### Effect Tests

### Arbitrary tests

arbitrary tests can be rolled using three options:
- from the chat using **`/s`** and any step number.
- from the dice symbol, which opens up a small roll prompt 
- from a journal entry by entering **`@Roll(/s <ANYSTEP>)(<DESCRIPTION>)`**

### General Roll information

all rolls will generate success and extra success information if a difficulty is set for the roll. If a difficulty is set, the chat will also indicate success or failure by coloring the background of the roll result in green or red. The **Rule of One** is although supported and will show it in the chat message.
In addition all dice in Earthdawn will explode.

### Modifications

the system supports two types of modifications, increasing or decreasing the step or adding additional dice (like karma) to the roll.
