## Ability rolls (usage)

Most abilities (talents, skills, devotions, powers etc.) in Earthdawn are used in a similar way. The Actor owning the ability has a list entry of the ability on the sheet. At the very front of the list entry there is a dice symbol, which turns if the mouse hovers of the list item. If the dice icon is clicked, a roll gets initiated, taking all available information into account (target, boni, mali etc.). The Roll prompt will show an overview all all available information and provides the option to add modifiers before confirming the roll.

Some abilities though, are not meant to be rolled (e.g. sprint). They have an Effect and cost a few strain for their activation. These abilities do not create dice symbol while hovering with the mouse, but instead show a blood drops icon. If these icons are clicked, the strain value is taken as damage and a message is created in the chat without any roll.
