this user function is responsible for differentiating which items can be added to a specific actor type, and which can not. In addition if necessary this function calls [UF_ActorItems-ValidateDropItem ](../User%20Functions/UF_ActorItems/UF_ActorItems-ValidateDropItem.md) for validations and [UF_ActorItems-showOptionsPrompt](../User%20Functions/UF_ActorItems/UF_ActorItems-showOptionsPrompt) if user interactions are required.
