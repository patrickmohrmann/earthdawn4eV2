this function adds to the [Foundry Core Function createEmbeddedDocuments](https://foundryvtt.com/api/classes/foundry.abstract.Document.html#createEmbeddedDocuments). 

in addition to the core function, this function works as a preprocessor to the [UF_ActorItems-preCreate](../User%20Functions/UF_ActorItems/UF_ActorItems-preCreate.md) to add some specific information to that functionality (like if a user interaction is required or not etc.).
