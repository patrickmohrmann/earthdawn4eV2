this function is triggered by any reaction activation from a chat message. <br> This function first checks if the user triggering the event is either a Game Master or a User with a configured actor who is the owner of that reaction ability. <br> If this check is done, an ability roll is triggered with the difficulty set to the chat message result. <br> On a successful result, another function is called [UF_ChatMessage-UpdateChatMessage](../User%20Functions/UF_ChatMessage-UpdateChatMessage.md).
