A successful action test can get extra successes by exceeding the difficulty number. For every 5 points high than the difficulty number another extra success will be added to the result.

**Note:** Difference between Number of Successes and Number of Extra Successes.
Earthdawn differentiates between extra successes and successes. Extra Successes are usually one point lower than successes. Successes as well as extra successes can have an impact on the effectiveness of Abilities (e.g. taunt grants a malus for every success). Extra successes can be used to trigger special maneuvers, while successes can't.
